        <h3>NUBS</h3>
        <div class="backstory">
            <p>Similarly to his twin Bean, Nubs lives for adventure. Whether it’s road-tripping through the countryside or discovering hidden gems in town, he’s always searching for something new. But while he loves exploring, his biggest fear is leaving people behind—especially Lini. He supports her dreams, but sometimes worries that she’s so focused on success that she’ll drift away. So, he makes it his mission to remind her (and everyone else) to take a break, go on a drive, and enjoy the little adventures life offers.</p>
