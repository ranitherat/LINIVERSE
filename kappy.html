        <h3>KAPPY</h3>
        <div class="backstory">
            <p>Kappy is the life of the party, always cracking jokes and turning any moment into a performance. But few know that before every big show, he gets terrible stage fright. Recently, he’s learned to embrace his flaws and turn them into laughter. He believes music should be fun, and even if he hits a wrong note, as long as his friends are singing along, that’s all that matters.</p>
