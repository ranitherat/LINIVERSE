        <div class="backstory">
            <p>Maki believes that strength is everything—training hard, staying fit, and pushing limits. But what no one knows is that her journey started because of Nelly. One day, while hiking, Nelly fell asleep mid-walk, and Maki carried them all the way home. That moment made her realize the importance of strength—not just physical, but emotional too. She’s great at lifting weights but struggles with lifting her feelings. For now, she keeps it a secret, but one day, maybe she’ll find the courage to say how she feels.</p>
