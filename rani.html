        <h3>RANI</h3>
        <div class="backstory">
            <p>Rani always believed that everyone deserves a moment of peace. Growing up, she saw her friends constantly stressed and knew she wanted to create a space where they could unwind. She opened Rani’s Retreat, a cozy spa where friends come to relax with warm tea, soothing music, and good books. But while she helps others de-stress, Rani struggles to take her own advice—she rarely slows down and secretly pushes herself too hard. Thankfully, Kappy and the others remind her that she need rest too.</p>
