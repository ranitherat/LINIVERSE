        <h3>NELLY</h3>
        <div class="backstory">
            <p>Nelly is known for being effortlessly cool and relaxed, always found lounging under the sun or snoozing in the coziest spots. Most think they don’t care about much, but the truth is, Nelly has a quiet way of showing love. They remember the little things—bringing an extra pillow for Maki, staying late to help Kappy rehearse, or saving a snack for Nubs after a long trip. They may not say much, but their actions speak louder than words. And while they may nap often, they never sleep through the moments that truly matter.</p>
