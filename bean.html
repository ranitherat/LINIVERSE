        <div class="backstory">
            <p>Bean believes that food is more than just something to eat—it’s a way to show love. She bakes with her heart, always making sure her friends have their favorite treats when they need them most. Her bakery is the heart of the town, where everyone gathers to laugh, share stories, and feel at home. But sometimes, Bean wonders if people only stay for the food and not for her. She’s learning that true friendships last beyond a shared meal and that she’s loved for who she is, not just what she makes.</p>
