        <h3>LINI</h3>
        <div class="backstory">
            <p>Lini has always dreamed big. From a young age, she knew she wanted to create something meaningful, but the road to success hasn’t been easy. She’s faced failures, rejections, and moments of doubt where she wonders if she’s doing enough. But Lini refuses to give up—she works tirelessly to build her dreams, knowing that even the smallest steps matter. Nubs, her biggest supporter, reminds her that success isn’t just about working hard, but also about enjoying the journey.</p>
