        <div class="backstory">
            <p>Milo sees life through his camera lens, capturing the beauty in everything—from the joy in Kappy’s performances to the warmth of Bean’s freshly baked bread. He believes every moment deserves to be remembered, but sometimes, he gets so caught up in documenting life that he forgets to experience it. His friends remind him that while memories are important, so is living them. Slowly, Milo is learning to put the camera down once in a while and simply be present.</p>
